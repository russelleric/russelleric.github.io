    <p>Tiny Points in Space is a virtual reality simulation to help teach Calculus. The goal of the project was to create an inexpensive virtual reality experience to help users better visualize the three-dimensional models, representations, and graphs that are critical to learning advanced mathematics like Calculus. An ideal solution would strengthen the ability of students to be mentally fluent moving between symbolic equations, two dimensional diagrams, and three dimensional mental representations. Using relatively inexpensive hardware (a computer, the Oculus Rift and a game controller) and open source software developed as a part of this project, we would like to give advanced mathematics students and instructors a new way to explore three-dimensional representations of mathematics from a first person, immersive perspective. We hoped that this experience will not only allow students to achieve a greater understanding of the particular model or graph being examined, but also scaffold studentsâ€™ creation of their own mental three-dimensional representations of symbolic equations and two dimensional diagrams.</p>

<p>The simulation was built with Unity3D and Python with the SymPy library. SymPy is used for the math calculations. The resulting meshes are then dynamically built within Unity. In addition to viewing the resulting graph, users can interact with it to further learning. Currently traces, tangent lines, and regions of integration are functional with the hopes of adding more features in the future.</p>

<p>I managed the team of six developers and artists. Throughout the project I helped with design and technical issues. By the end of the project I had also implemented a virtual reality friendly user interface.</p>
