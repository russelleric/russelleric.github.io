    <p>Picodroid is a kinesthetic game about atoms and subatomic particles. Two players race to build a specific atom. They do this by collecting protons, neutrons, and electrons. Each player can see their current progress as well as the goal atom. Their atom’s current state changes every time they collect a particle. What players aren’t show is specifically how many of each subatomic particle they need. Players need to understand how each particle effects an atom’s properties.</p>

<p>The game was built using XNA along with Microsoft’s Kinect SDK. I was the lead artist for the project and worked closely with the developer.</p>
