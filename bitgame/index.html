    <p>This game was created for a local STEM event. It introduces players to binary numbers in a cooperative game. The game progresses like most games in the infinite runner genre. The character is constantly moving to the right. Player(s) can toggle any bit in a six bit number on the character. If the character’s number isn’t the same as the wall’s by the time of impact, the character dies and the game restarts.</p>

<p>With the game being designed for an event, the more people who could play simultaneously the better. We also wanted players to have to work together and communicate. The hardest part about the game isn’t figuring out the correct sequence, its getting everyone to work together. To force this collaboration on the players we created a custom Arduino-based six-button controller. Each button toggles one of the six bits that make up the character’s number. The buttons are spaced out along a long surface. This not only allows up to six people to play at once, it also makes it difficult to play the game as a solo experience.</p>

<p>The game was built with Unity3D. I was one of the game designer and the sole developer and artist for this project.</p>
